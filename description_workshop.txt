This mod makes most of the surface generate as a desert, and creates a bunch of underground deserts throughout the world.
Only for those who are looking for pain and suffering, and to die to rolling cacti every 10 seconds.
Sand also will not fall if there is more sand above it, helping a little with keeping you sane.
There are several config options to maximize pain, or to just be funny.

If by chance the world fails to generate, (an error appears,) try and re-generate the world.
If the issue persists, contact me on Discord. MooMoo#6969 (moomoo.dll) through the TmodLoader discord.

There may be some odd spots in the world, due to this being my first worldgen mod, and because of how oddly sand interacts with the world.

Thanks to several members of the TmodLoader discord for helping me with certain worldgen stuff.
